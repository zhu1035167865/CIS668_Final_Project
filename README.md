# CIS668_Final_Project


Dataset
In order to test this algorithm I prepared a dataset containing a list of paragraphs from F. Nietzsche. The preprocessing is aimed at extracting and grouping text by paragraphs. I also perform some exploratory data analysis along the way.

The original dataset 'nietzsche.txt' is publicly availabe on Kaggle:
